        Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).The disease was first identified in 2019 in Wuhan, the capital of Hubei China, and has since spread globally, resulting in the 2019â€“20 coronavirus pandemic.Common symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath. Muscle pain, sputum production, diarrhea, and sore throat are less common.While the majority of cases result in mild symptoms,some progress to pneumonia and multi-organ failure.As of 23 March 2020, the rate of deaths per number of diagnosed cases is 4.4 percent; however, it ranges from 0.2 percent to 15 percent, according to age group and other health problems.

        The virus is typically spread from one person to another via respiratory droplets produced during coughing.It may also be spread from touching contaminated surfaces and then touching one's face.The virus can live on surfaces up to 72 hours.Time from exposure to onset of symptoms is generally between two and fourteen days, with an average of five days.The standard method of diagnosis is by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) from a nasopharyngeal swab. The infection can also be diagnosed from a combination of symptoms, risk factors and a chest CT scan showing features of pneumonia.
